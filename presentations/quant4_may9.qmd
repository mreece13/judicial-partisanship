## Background

Judges in the US are normatively expected to be neutral interpreters of the law

. . .

-   Yet, research consistently demonstrates ideology influences judge's decisions [e.g., @martin_dynamic_2002; @bailey_comparable_2007; @epstein_judicial_2007; @clark_locating_2010; @lauderdale_scaling_2014; @epstein_behavior_2012; @bonica_politics_2017]

. . .

**What influences a judge's ideology? Do features of the electoral system matter?**

## Judicial Selection Systems

## Theory

Other policymakers are responsive to electoral system dynamics

. . .

-   Members of Congress modify their beliefs towards the median voter in competitive elections [@ansolabehere2001]

. . .

-   Presidents are responsive to public opinion when reelection is imminent or when the topic is particularly relevant [@canes-wrone2004]

. . .

I expect that, dependent on the type of electoral system in place, judges are responsive to the body selecting them and become more sensitive closer to the selection date

## Estimating Judicial Ideology

Considerable effort has been taken to estimate the "ideology" of judges [@bonica_estimating_2021], of which the most commonly used measure is the DIME score [@bonica2014]

. . .

DIME scores are based on campaign contributions which enables a common latent scale among political actors

. . .

-   This does not work as well for judges. In some states, judges do not run for election nor do they regularly contribute to other campaigns

-   DIME instead imputes data for appointed judges who have not contributed, based on the score of the appointing governor or median member of the appointing legislative body [@bonica_common-space_2015]

## Proposed Methodology

The most common information available from judges are the decisions and written opinions they issue

-   Using decisions was the original method for estimating judicial ideology [@brace2000; @martin_dynamic_2002; @epstein_judicial_2007]

    -   Using opinions has empirically challenging, but recent computer science advances have made this more possible [@fagni2022]

-   Decisions and opinions are also theoretically important

## Data

I gather judicial opinions from *CourtListener*

-   The data includes opinions from all 50 states between 1996-2024

-   I remove unanimous and unsigned decisions

. . .

-   From each text, I remove citations

    -   I do not remove stopwords, stem, or otherwise preprocess

. . .

Represents 26,000 judicial opinions, with an average of 25,000 tokens per opinion. These are then split into sentences to pass to the model

## Modeling Ideology with Text

Multiple approaches

-   Predict DIME scores for missing data

    -   *Problem: Not missing at random*

. . .

-   Structural topic model

    -   *Problem: Bag of words*

. . .

-   Citation networks [@clark_locating_2010; @schmid2022]

    -   *Problem: Context of the citation is extremely relevant*

. . .

-   **BERTopic** [@grootendorst2022]

    -   Semi-supervised topic modeling based on registered parties

    -   Dynamic topic modeling over time
